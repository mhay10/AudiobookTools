Series of scripts and links to help with audiobook related activities.

## Scripts

- **golden-audio.py** - Downloads audiobooks from goldenaudiobooks.com, hdaudiobooks.com, etc.

## Other Downloading Tools

- [Deezloader Remix](https://www.deezloader.app/download/) (best option for Deezer)
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) (best option for YouTube, Soundcloud, and *maybe* others)
  - Use this first if you don't know which program to use.
- [Audiobook Bay](https://audiobookbay.net) (best torrent site)
- [LibreVox](http://librivox.org/search) (best for public domain)
- Your local library (best option for all of them)

## Hosting options - For streaming to multiple devices
