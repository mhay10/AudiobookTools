# AudiobookTools

A set of scripts and links to help with audiobook-related activities.

## Scripts

- **create_m4b_from_asin.py** - Creates an audiobook with chapter data and a cover image taken from Audible
- **create_m4b_from_cue.py** - Creates an audiobook with chapter data taken from a CUE file
- **create_m4b_from_files.py** - Creates an audiobook where each file is a chapter
- **dl_golden_audio.py** - Downloads audiobooks from goldenaudiobooks.com, hdaudiobooks.net, etc.

## Other Downloading Tools

- [Deezloader Remix](https://www.deezloader.app/download/) (best option for Deezer)
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) (best option for YouTube, Soundcloud, and _maybe_ others)
  - Use this first if you don't know which program to use.
- [Audiobook Bay](https://audiobookbay.net) (best torrent site)
- [LibreVox](http://librivox.org/search) (best for public domain)
- Your local library (best option for all of them)
  - For CD audiobooks, you can rip them to MP3 using [Exact Audio Copy](https://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/)

## Android Apps - Copy audiobook files to your phone to listen

- [Musicolet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.krosbits.musicolet&hl=en_US&gl=US)
- [Pulsar](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhmsoft.pulsar&hl=en_US&gl=US)
- [BlackPlayer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.musicplayer.blackplayerfree&hl=en_US&gl=US)

## Hosting options - For streaming to multiple devices

- [AudiobookShelf](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf) - Self-hosted audiobook and podcast server (my personal favorite)
  - Has a mobile app and website for listening
- [Booksonic-Air](https://github.com/popeen/Booksonic-Air) - Self-hosted audiobook server based on Airsonic
  - No iOS app available for Booksonic's specific features
  - Any Subsonic-compatible app should work
