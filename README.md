# AudiobookTools

Series of scripts and links to help with audiobook related activities.

## Scripts

- **chapterize.py** - Adds chapters to m4b file from Audible id
- **golden-audio.py** - Downloads audiobooks from goldenaudiobooks.com, hdaudiobooks.com, etc.

## Other Downloading Tools

- [Deezloader Remix](https://www.deezloader.app/download/) (best option for Deezer)
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) (best option for YouTube, Soundcloud, and *maybe* others)
  - Use this first if you don't know which program to use.
- [Audiobook Bay](https://audiobookbay.net) (best torrent site)
- [LibreVox](http://librivox.org/search) (best for public domain)
- Your local library (best option for all of them)
  - For CD audiobooks, you can rip them to mp3 using [Exact Audio Copy](https://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/)

## Hosting options

- [AudiobookShelf](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf) - Self-hosted audiobook and podcast server (my personal favorite)
  - Has mobile app and website for listening
- [AudiobookSuite](https://gitlab.com/Shrimperator/AudiobookSuite) - Local player and library for Windows systems
  - Uses VLC for playback so compatability is almost garunteed
- [Booksonic-Air](https://github.com/popeen/Booksonic-Air) - Self-hosted audiobook server based on Airsonic
  - No iOS app available for Booksonic specific features
  - Any Subsonic compatible app should work
